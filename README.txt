Hey there! Thanks for downloading Florithmetic; I hope you'll enjoy it!

One thing, before you run this game - it relies heavily on a font called Open Sans. You may (or may not) have this font installed on your computer.
For the best gaming experience (being a font snob, it *really is important*), please install the fonts I have included in the 'Fonts' folder in the same directory as this file.
To install fonts in Windows, simply select all, and click install - then this game will work great (and look PROFESSIONAL!)

Enjoy!
